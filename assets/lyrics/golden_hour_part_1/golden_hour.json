            "Golden hour",
            "The brightest moments in life",
            "Those moments are like quick flashes",
            "And never come back",
            "Everyone has their own special times in life",
            "Some people look forward to what's ahead",
            "While others cherish the memories of what's gone by",
            "But just like every beginning has an end",
            "What should we dream of and hope",
            "For as these fleeting moments pass?",
            "What should we call, all the other times",
            "Apart from those beautiful",
            "And shining moments?",
            "Could living for the moment leave",
            "Our hearts feeling emptier?",
            "The moments of laughter with friends",
            "Quiet family dinners, relaxing weekends",
            "With loved ones",
            "Could these be the real golden hours",
            "Of our lives?"
